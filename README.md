# BigDataAnalysisProject

This project repository is a comprehensive showcase of my data preprocessing, scripting, and analysis endeavors using Tableau Prep and R. Unstructured, raw datasets are converted into clean, structured, and valuable resources, and insights are subsequently derived from them.

Here's what you can find within this repository:

1. Raw Datasets: This contains the original unprocessed data. These datasets, often with missing data, inconsistencies, and outliers, serve as the starting point for our journey towards data enlightenment.

2. Clean Datasets: The end result of the cleaning process. This includes datasets that have been reshaped, filled, and corrected using Tableau Prep. They are now primed for further analysis and model building.

3. R Scripts: A collection of R scripts used for advanced data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. These scripts take the clean data and extract meaningful insights, trends, and patterns from them. They are well-commented and structured for easy understanding and replication.

4. Data Analysis and Visualizations: This is the destination of our data journey. Leveraging R's powerful statistical and visualization libraries, I've performed various analyses and produced a range of data visualizations that help us understand the patterns, relationships, and trends within the data.

5. Documentation: Detailed notes explaining the data cleaning, scripting, and analysis processes. This ensures full transparency, reproducibility, and understanding of the data transformations and analytical decisions made during the project.

Feel free to explore, use these resources as references for your own data operations, and offer your valuable feedback. Remember, data is only as good as the cleaning and analysis that it undergoes. Let's together strive for data integrity and insightful analyses.
